README.TXT // Salamander Skins theme for Drupal 5 and 6.

Thank you for downloading this theme!


ABOUT THE SALAMANDER SKINS THEME:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
Salamander Skins is largely a ground-up rewrite of the Salamander theme. 
The main theme looks much like Salamander but it features 16 more color 
styles, 15 collapsible regions, suckerfish menus, left or right menus 
position, fluid or fixed widths, built-in IE transparent PNG fix, and 
lots more. The theme validates XHTML 1.0 Strict / CSS 2, and it is 
cross-browser compatible; works perfect in Firefox, IE 6, IE 7, Safari, 
Google Chrome.


MODULE SUPPORT
-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
This theme can support virtualy any module.
It has been heavily tested with:
  - AdSense module;
  - Image module;
  - Logintoboggan;
  - Panels;
  - TinyMCE;


THEME MODIFICATION
-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
Salamander Skins theme alow many sub-themes as plugins. More sub-themes will 
be available at http://www.radut.net/salamanderskins/

If you feel like giving the theme a look of your own, I recommend:
  - replace the graphic files in the images folder of any sub-theme, keeping 
  dimensions.
  - and/or change the text colors in the stylesheet style.css.
  - you can also modify the page width (fixed or fluid) by changing the following 
  	line in style-base.css file: 
  		#page {width: 95%;} 	-> default fluid width... to
  		#page {width: 800px;} -> 800px fixed width
  - to have the menus on the right just uncomment .navcont class in style.css


USING THE PRIMARY LINKS MENU
-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
The menu can either be a two-level static menu or a suckerfish drop-down menu.

Out of the box the theme will show the primary and secondary menu. If you select 
(/admin/build/menu/settings) the same menu as primary links then secondary 
links will display the appropriate second level of your navigation hierarchy.

If you want to use the dropdown menus do the followings:
- go to /admin/build/block and choose the Suckerfish Menu region for the 
Primary Links block;
- go to /admin/build/menu and enable the checkbox to have all Parent Menu Items 
Expanded (this is very important);
- go to /admin/build/menu/settings and choose for "Menu containing secondary links" 
the option "No Secondary links".
